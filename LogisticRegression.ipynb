Breast cancer tumors are very complicated at the cellular level, and this makes determining whether a patient's tumor is malignant (dangerous) or benign (not dangerous) a challenge. Your task will be to build a classifier that can determine whether a sample is malignant or benign to help your colleague!\n","\n","Every patient that arrives at the hospital undergoes a biopsy of their tumor. This means that a small sample of the tumor is taken from the patient and various metrics are recorded about it, including: radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, concave points, symmetry, and fractal dimension. \n","\n","Using a large dataset of labeled biospy samples from breast cancer tumors, you will build your binary classification model to determine whether a tumor is malignant or benign based on these features. Then, this model can help you to better determine diagnoses for new patients who arrive at the hospital.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CwIq3r8RENiw"},"source":["## Today...\n","We will explore together the steps that you could take to help your friend solve this problem!\n","\n","#### 1.

These cells were removed as part of a biopsy of a tumor from a patient in which a small amount of fluid/tissue from the tumor is sampled with a special needle. Then, the cells in this sample are strained with different dyes to visualize their shapes, how much DNA they have, etc. All these properties can help to give hints as to whether cells are rapidly dividing cancer cells or not. \n","\n","Our dataset reports 10 different features of the biopsies. Here's what each means:\n","\n","1. $Radius$: Average distance from the center of the cell's nucleus to its perimeter.\n","2. $Perimeter$: Total distance between points defining the cell's nuclear perimeter.\n","3. $Area$: Nuclear area is measured by counting the number of pixels on the interior of the nucleus and adding one-half of the pixels in the perimeter.\n","\n","The following image should give a visual to what these cell nucleus features look like: \n","\n","![perimeter](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1-U43OAojYbMY9gIlpvLHPNr3V2saqqHJ)\n","\n","4. $Compactness$: Calculated as the compactness of the cell nuclei using the\n","formula $perimeter^2/area$\n","5. $Smoothness$: Measures the smoothness of a nuclear contour by measuring the difference between the length of a radial line and the mean length of the lines surrounding it.

This brings up the question of how we can evaluate how good a classification is. \n","\n","Often, we do this by looking at the rates of true positives/true negatives/false positives/false negatives. Let's define these important terms:\n","\n","**True positive rate (TPR)**: Sometimes called sensitvity, the TPR is the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such. An analogy would be the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the disease in some population.\n","\n","**True negative rate (TNR)**: Sometimes called specificity, the TNR is the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such. An analogy would be the the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the disease in some population.\n","\n","**False positive rate (FPR)**: The FPR is the proportion of actual negatives that are incorrectly identified as positives. An analogy would be the percentage of healthy people who are incorrectly identified as having the disease.\n","\n","**False negative rate (FNR)**: The FNR is the proportion of actual positives that are incorrectly identified as negatives. An analogy would be the percentage of sick people who are incorrectly identified as healthy.\n","\n","A key insight is that there is a tradeoff when trying to reduce the different types of errors. For instance, if we want to increase our TPR (thus decrease our FNR by correctly identifying more sick people), our improvements will have to increase the number of people we guess to be sick. However, such an improvement will decrease our TNR (thus inrease our FPR by guessing more healty people are sick). \n","\n","Sometimes, one type of error is worse than the others for a given problem.
