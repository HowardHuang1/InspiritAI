### Generative Adversarial Networks
We created a network architecture to produce artificially generated face images using the dataset Labeled Faces in the Wild. The data preprocessing just involves downsizing the images to 28 x 28 pixels. We ran two ML algorithms: the generator which produces the fake images and the discriminator which tries to guess whether the image is real or fake. Each algorithm is given a reward function and over several cycles, the generator will get better and producing fake images that are indistinguishable to the discriminator.
